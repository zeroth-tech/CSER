# CSER

We think that the transfer of physical goods can be settled the same way we transfer digital currencies.  Our supply chains are broken and we have been focused on solving the wrong problem.

The goal Confidential Settlement with Embedded Rights (CSER) is to establish a new cryptographic primitive that can be used to agree upon a set of rules on how a product should be transferred and then use some novel cryptography to settle the transaction in a way that keeps the details known to only the trading partners but lets them provide proof that the settlement occurred. 

This is not going to be easy, supply chains involve a vast ecosystem of entrenched players and it cannot be known who will participate ahead of time.  So CSER also focuses on a way to embed user rights to a product into the transaction, these rights help to enforce the rules, but they also give the participant visibility into the history of transactions involving their products.

This only works if everyone can use it - it needs to be a common good.  This is not a popular point of view with existing supply chain software providers, so we need to prove its value and limitations first.

Our project is new, but we have been thinking about this for a long time....
